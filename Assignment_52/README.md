# DeepLearning VS MLP

in this assignment we are going to compare 4 dataset accuracy .
Once , test our datasets with MLP  , and then with deeplearning . 

# RESULTS 
these are test accuracy results :
We see that , in complex datasets like Cifar10 or Cifar100 , which contains more detailed and diverse images , using DeepLearning gives more test accuracy compared with MLP . 

|| MLP | DeepLearning |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
MNIST | 0.97  | 0.9916 |
FMNIST | 0.87  | 0.906 |
CIFAR10 | 0.48 | 0.84 |
CIFAR100 | 0.13  | 0.55 |
